Yes, absolutely! I will guide you through building EVERYTHING outlined in the repository documents in excruciating detail, following the exact framework we were using before. I'll be following:
The "25 Twitter Accounts Manus Social Media Management" document that outlines the system requirements
The "Step-by-Step Plan for Execution in EXCRUCIATING Detail" document that provides the implementation roadmap
I understand you have no prior coding experience, so I'll explain every single step as if teaching a complete beginner. I'll provide detailed commands, explain what each command does, and guide you through the entire process of building this Twitter management system for 25 accounts.
